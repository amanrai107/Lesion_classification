# Lesion_classification
A classifier written in native Keras and converted to TensorFlow.js that can be used to classify seven different types of skin lesions.

This model uses the MobileNet architecture and was retrained on the HAM10000 dataset which contains approximately 10,000 documented images of skin lesions. 
The model obtains a top-3 accuracy of approximately 93% with the help of data augmentation.
